# Grocli Architecture - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What Was Done

This project has been successfully set up with a scalable, production-ready architecture:

### ✅ Core Setup
- **Riverpod** state management (replacing Provider)
- **GoRouter** declarative navigation  
- **Freezed** for immutable models
- **Environment configuration** with flutter_dotenv
- **Comprehensive theming** (light/dark mode)
- **Feature-first folder structure**

### ✅ Build Status
- **0 errors** in flutter analyze ✓
- **Builds successfully** for all platforms ✓
- **Code generation** working ✓
- **80 warnings** (mostly deprecations and unused imports - non-blocking)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# 2. Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# 3. Generate code
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 4. Run
flutter run
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start code generation watcher (in one terminal)
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run the app (in another terminal)
flutter run
```

## 🔑 Key Files

### Core Configuration
- `lib/main.dart` - App entry point with Riverpod setup
- `lib/core/config/env_config.dart` - Environment variables
- `lib/core/router/app_router.dart` - Navigation routes
- `lib/core/providers/riverpod_providers.dart` - Provider definitions
- `lib/shared/theme/app_theme.dart` - Theme configuration

### Environment Files
- `.env.example` - Template (copy this)
- `.env` - Your local config (gitignored)
- `.env.development` - Dev environment
- `.env.production` - Production environment

### Configuration Files
- `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies and assets
- `analysis_options.yaml` - Lint rules and code style

## 💡 Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. Create folder: `lib/features/my_feature/`
2. Add subfolders: `presentation/pages/`, `presentation/widgets/`
3. Create providers in `core/providers/` if needed
4. Add routes to `core/router/app_router.dart`

### Creating a Model
```dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'my_model.freezed.dart';
part 'my_model.g.dart';

@freezed
class MyModel with _$MyModel {
  const factory MyModel({
    required String id,
    required String name,
  }) = _MyModel;
  
  factory MyModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>
      _$MyModelFromJson(json);
}
```

Then run: `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

### Creating a Provider
```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

final myProvider = Provider<MyService>((ref) {
  return MyService();
});
```

### Using a Provider
```dart
class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final value = ref.watch(myProvider);
    return Text('$value');
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Useful Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run code generation (one-time)
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run code generation (watch mode)
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Clean generated files
flutter pub run build_runner clean

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Format code
dart format .

# Run tests
flutter test

# Run app
flutter run

# Build for production
flutter build apk --release  # Android
flutter build ios --release  # iOS
flutter build web --release  # Web
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Environment variables not loading"
- Ensure `.env` file exists in project root
- Check it's listed in `pubspec.yaml` under assets
- Restart the app (hot reload doesn't reload .env)

### "Build runner not generating files"
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner clean
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### "Dependency conflicts"
- **Do not** update freezed beyond v2.5.2
- **Do not** add riverpod_generator or riverpod_lint yet
- These have analyzer version conflicts with hive_generator

### "Firebase not working"
```bash
# Configure Firebase
flutterfire configure
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Version Constraints
- **freezed**: Must stay at ^2.5.2 (not newer versions)
- **hive_generator**: At 2.0.1, requires analyzer <7.0.0
- Wait for hive_generator update before upgrading analyzer-dependent packages

### Generated Files
- `*.g.dart` - Generated by build_runner, don't edit
- `*.freezed.dart` - Generated by freezed, don't edit
- These are gitignored and excluded from analysis

### Environment Files
- **Never commit** `.env`, `.env.development`, or `.env.production`
- **Always commit** `.env.example` as a template
- Store sensitive keys securely

## 📱 Platform Support

All platforms are configured:
- ✅ iOS
- ✅ Android
- ✅ Web
- ✅ macOS
- ✅ Windows
- ✅ Linux
