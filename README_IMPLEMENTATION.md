### 🚀 Next Steps to Run

1. **Setup Firebase**
   ```bash
   # Install Firebase CLI
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   
   # Login to Firebase
   firebase login
   
   # Initialize Firebase for Flutter
   flutterfire configure
   ```

2. **Generate Hive Adapters**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase Services**
   - Enable Authentication (Email, Google, Apple)
   - Create Firestore database
   - Setup Storage for voice messages
   - Enable Cloud Messaging
   - (Optional) Setup Cloud Functions for AI

4. **API Keys for AI (Optional)**
   - Update `lib/core/services/ai_service.dart` with your AI API endpoint
   - Or implement on-device AI using TensorFlow Lite

5. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### 🔧 Configuration Files

- **Firebase**: Run `flutterfire configure` to generate `firebase_options.dart`
- **Android**: Update `android/app/google-services.json`
- **iOS**: Update `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- **Permissions**: Already configured in AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist

### 🎨 Features Overview

#### List Creation Flow
1. User taps "New List"
2. Can type or record voice input
3. AI extracts items from input
4. User can edit/remove items
5. Save list with category

#### Collaboration Flow
1. User shares list with contacts
2. Sets permissions (View/Edit)
3. Real-time sync across all participants
4. In-list chat for coordination
5. Track who completed items

#### Offline Support
- All data cached with Hive
- Changes sync when online
- Optimistic UI updates

### 🔐 Security

- Firebase Security Rules needed for:
  - Firestore (lists, users, messages)
  - Storage (voice messages, avatars)
- Implement user blocking
- Validate permissions server-side

### 📝 Notes

- The app uses placeholder data until Firebase is configured
- AI service uses basic rule-based extraction; integrate with OpenAI/Claude for production
- Voice messages need Firebase Storage integration
- Push notifications require FCM setup
- Contact syncing requires platform-specific permissions

### 🐛 Known Limitations

- Hive adapters need to be generated with build_runner
- Firebase configuration required before running
- AI features are basic (rule-based); integrate real AI for production
- Voice message playback not fully implemented
- Some TODO items in code for edge cases
