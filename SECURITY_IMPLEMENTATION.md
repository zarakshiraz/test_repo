# Security Rules Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of comprehensive Firebase security rules for this Flutter application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Firestore Security Rules (`firestore.rules`)

Comprehensive security rules covering:

- **Users Collection** - User-based access with field validation
- **Memberships Collection** - Role-based permissions (viewer, editor, admin)
- **Contacts Collection** - Owner-only access with blocking subcollection
- **Reminders Collection** - Ownership with optional sharing and block enforcement

### 2. Storage Security Rules (`storage.rules`)

Storage access controls for:

- **Avatars** (`/avatars/{userId}/{fileName}`)
  - Any authenticated user can read
  - Only owner can upload/delete
  - Image files only, max 5MB
  
- **Audio** (`/audio/{userId}/{fileName}`)
  - Only owner can read/write/delete
  - Audio files only, max 10MB

### 3. Automated Testing Suite

**58 comprehensive tests** covering:

- ✅ 10 tests for Users collection
- ✅ 10 tests for Memberships collection
- ✅ 10 tests for Contacts/Blocking
- ✅ 14 tests for Reminders collection
- ✅ 14 tests for Storage rules

All tests verify:
- Allowed operations for owners
- Denied operations for non-owners
- Role-based access for members
- Block enforcement
- Unauthenticated user restrictions
- Field validation
- Content type validation

### 4. CI Integration

Created scripts for continuous integration:

- `yarn test:security` - NPM script to run all tests
- `scripts/test-security.sh` - Bash script for local testing
- Uses Firebase Emulator Suite for isolated testing

### 5. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation includes:

- **`docs/security-rules.md`** - Complete security model documentation
  - Detailed rules for each collection
  - Permission matrices
  - Usage examples
  - Limitations and future enhancements
  - Troubleshooting guide
  
- **`test/security/README.md`** - Testing documentation
  - How to run tests
  - Test structure explanation
  - Debugging guide
  - CI integration instructions

- **Updated `README.md`** - Project overview with security features

## Files Created

### Configuration Files

- `test/security/storage.test.js` - Storage rules tests

### Documentation
- `docs/security-rules.md` - Main security documentation
- `test/security/README.md` - Testing guide
- `SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

### Scripts
- `scripts/test-security.sh` - Executable test script

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Firestore and Storage rules files enforce documented permissions with no TODO placeholders**
- All rules are complete and production-ready
- No placeholder comments or unfinished sections

✅ **Emulator tests cover key scenarios and all pass**
- 58 automated tests covering all collections and storage paths
- Tests verify both allowed and denied operations
- All scenarios documented and tested

✅ **CI script exists to run security tests locally**
- `yarn test:security` command available
- `scripts/test-security.sh` bash script provided
- Automatically starts/stops emulators

✅ **Security documentation reflects implemented rules and guidance for future updates**
- Complete documentation in `docs/security-rules.md`
- Includes limitations and future TODOs section
- Testing guide and troubleshooting included

## Security Model Summary

```
Authentication (Firebase Auth) → Required for all operations
    ↓
Firestore Collections:
├─ users/{userId}           → Owner-only access
├─ memberships/{id}         → Owner + role-based member access
├─ contacts/{userId}        → Owner-only access
│  └─ blocked/{blockedId}   → Block list management
└─ reminders/{id}           → Owner access + optional sharing with block checks

Storage Paths:
├─ avatars/{userId}/*       → Owner write, authenticated read
└─ audio/{userId}/*         → Owner-only access
```

## Key Features

1. **User Privacy** - Users can only access their own data by default
2. **Collaboration** - Memberships support shared access with roles
3. **Blocking** - Contact blocks are enforced across reminders
4. **Content Validation** - File types and sizes are enforced
5. **Immutability** - Critical fields like `createdAt` and `userId` are protected
6. **Testing** - All rules are thoroughly tested with automated tests

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run all security tests
yarn test:security

# Or use the script
./scripts/test-security.sh
```

## Next Steps

To use these rules in production:

1. **Deploy rules to Firebase:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage
   ```

2. **Run tests before deployment:**
   ```bash
   yarn test:security
   ```

3. **Monitor in production:**
   - Check Firebase Console for rule denials
   - Review security metrics
   - Update rules as needed

4. **Consider future enhancements:**
   - Admin override capabilities
   - Audit logging
   - Usage quotas
   - Rate limiting
